# Ridiculousness

Instead of making a repository for all of the various small projects, I decided to make one to contain them all.  While others would typically label such a repo
miscellaneous, I am calling it 'Ridiculousness' since all the projects are a bit ridiculous (such as furniture designs and printer calibration).
